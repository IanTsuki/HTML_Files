In reality, he opts for the two-dimensional world of gaming over real life because he is an unhealthily obsessed otaku of galge games (a type of Japanese video game centered on interactions with attractive girls).  When he arrogantly accepts an anonymous offer to prove his supremacy at dating sim games, Keima is misled into aiding a naïve and impish demon from hell named Elucia "Elsie" de Lute Ima with her mission: retrieving runaway evil spirits who have escaped from hell and scattered themselves throughout the human world. Keima discovers that the only way to capture these spirits is to conquer what he hates the most: the unpredictable hearts of three-dimensional girls! Shackled to Elsie via a deadly collar, Keima now has his title of "God of Conquest" put to the ultimate test as he is forced to navigate through the hearts of a multitude of real-life girls.</TD><TD CLASS="Col4"><A TARGET=_self HREF=javascript:WinOpen('god.jpg')><IMG SRC="god.jpg" WIDTH=100 BORDER=0 TITLE="Image of The World God Only Knows"></A></TD></TR>

The price on his head is a fortune, and his path of destruction reaches across the arid wastelands of a desert planet. Unfortunately, most encounters with the spiky-haired gunslinger don't end well for the bounty hunters who catch up with him; someone almost always gets hurt—and it's never Vash. Oddly enough, for such an infamous fugitive, there's no proof that he's ever taken a life. In fact, he's a pacifist with a doughnut obsession who's more doofus than desperado. There's a whole lot more to him than his reputation lets on—Vash the Stampede definitely ain't your typical outlaw. </TD><TD CLASS="Col4"><A TARGET=_self HREF=javascript:WinOpen('tri.jpg')><IMG SRC="tri.jpg" WIDTH=100 BORDER=0 TITLE="Image of Trigun"></A></TD></TR>

They view the real world as just another lousy game; however, a strange e-mail challenging them to a chess match changes everything—the brother and sister are plunged into an otherworldly realm where they meet Tet, the God of Games.  The mysterious god welcomes Sora and Shiro to Disboard, a world where all forms of conflict—from petty squabbles to the fate of whole countries—are settled not through war, but by way of high-stake games.

In this strange land where the very idea of humanity is reduced to child’s play, the indifferent genius gamer duo of Sora and Shiro have finally found a real reason to keep playing games: to unite the sixteen races of Disboard, defeat Tet, and become the gods of this new, gaming-is-everything world. </TD><TD CLASS="Col4"><A TARGET=_self HREF=javascript:WinOpen('No.jpg')><IMG SRC="No.jpg" WIDTH=100 BORDER=0 TITLE="Image of No Game No Life"></A></TD></TR>

With the aid of "NerveGear" technology, players can control their avatars within the game using nothing but their own thoughts.  Kazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed "Kirito," is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on the first shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game’s creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game.  In order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players. Some are allies, while others are foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading group attempting to escape from the ruthless game. To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt to his new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.</TD><TD CLASS="Col4"><A TARGET=_self HREF=javascript:WinOpen('SAO.jpg')><IMG SRC="SAO.jpg" WIDTH=100 BORDER=0 TITLE="Image of Sword Art Online"></A></TD></TR>
